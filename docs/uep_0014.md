# Application Message Envelop

| UEP-6:2B | UEP-7:10B | UEP-12:60B | UEP-14 |
|:----|:-----|:-----|:-----|


## Motivation
Application message envelop is a data structure standardized message payload format in UEP-12, which carries actual social messages.
It also standardize the encryption and signing scheme for privacy protection.

## Data Structure
An envelop encodes type of cryptography credential and internal payloads as
```
<credtype:1byte><payloads:2bytes><scenario:2bytes><act:2bytes><credential_data:* bytes>[<payload_data>:popcount(payloads)]
```
`credtype` specify the type of encryption scheme and determines the data structure of the `credential_data`. 
`payloads` is bit-wise defined indicate the availability of each type of internal payloads. 
`scenario` is an identifier of the scenario module for particular social activity in the application.
`act` is an app-specific action operation code, which is interpreted by the application. 
`payload_data` is an array of internal payload data, may or may not, encrypted and are compactly packed in the order of payload types.

#### Reserved Scenarios
* `scenario:0x00` is the system reserved for core control messages
* `scenario:0x01` is for direct messaging and group chatting messages
* `scenario:0x02~0xff` is reserved for builtin core messages
* `scenario:0x100~0xffff` is for customized application messages


## Cryptography Scheme
Several cryptography schemes are designed for different messaging purposes. 
All designs share a common goal that identities of the sender and recipients 
should be sealed or implicitly specified, which is never revealed to the public.

### SealBox (`credtype:0x0`)
Cryptography scheme for 1:n (n<10) messaging that is encrypted and authenticated, which describes a list of `recipient` as
```
<recipient> := <cp:8bytes><reserved:15bits><direction:1bit><sealed_key:48bytes>
```
`cp` is the contact point to identify a recipient without leaking their identities as described in UEP-15.
`direction` indicates the sending direction and `sealed_key` is the encrypted 32-byte payload secret key for decrypting payloads
using authenticated cryptography (UEP-13)

The `credential_data` encodes information that allows a sealed payload key can be decrypted for each recipient
```
<nonce:24bytes><n:1byte>[<recipient>:n]
```
All recipients share a common payload key and a common nonce.

### Sealed Greeting (`credtype:0x1`)
Cryptography scheme for greeting messages that requesting contact adding.
```
<nonce:24bytes><recipient><greeting_cp:8bytes><sealed_key:80bytes><signature:64bytes>
```
`greeting_cp` is the contact point for greeting endpoint (UEP-15), `sealed_key` is 
the sealed payload key using asymmetric cryptography (UEP-13).
`signature` is signed over the 32-byte payload key by the sender for authenticity verification.

For the recipient being requested for contact adding, there are two ways for decryption.
* If the sender is yet a contact of the recipient, the sealed payload key can by decrypted based
on `sealed_secret` as an anonymous message. `signature` can verified using sender's `pubkey`, 
which will be available in decrypted payload.
* If the sender is already a contact of the recipient, the identity of the sender
can be found using the contact point in `recipient` and the sealed payload key can be decrypted 
based on `recipient.sealed_key`.

### Broadcast (`credtype:0x2,0x3`)
Cryptography scheme for 1:infinite messaging with no recipient specified. 
If the broadcast is sent to a dedicate swarm (`0x2`) which requires no contact point, the `credential_data`
will be just `<signature:64bytes>` resulted from signing over the entire payloads `[<payload_data>]`.

If the swarm is shared with other broadcast scope (`0x3`), a contact point will be required as
```
<cp:8bytes><signature:64bytes>
```


## Payloads
There are several types of payload that can be embedded in the envelop, and no more than one instance for each type.
Each `payload_data` encapsulates the actual data with encryption details with the actual content aligned to cipher blocks (32-byte block) as
```
<type:4bits><padding:4bits><block_count:7bits><encrypted:1bit><data:data_size bytes>
```
`type` is the type of the payload, `padding` is the padding size in the encrypted data, 
`block_count` is the number of cipher blocks that the encrypted data aligned to. The exact `data_size` of the `<data>` is calculated as
```
data_size = block_count*32              // if 'encrypted' bit is set
data_size = block_count*32 + padding    // if 'encrypted' bit is unset
```

If `data` is encrypted, it can be decrypted using AES256 with, in default, the payload key obtained from `credential_data`.
The size of the original data is `block_count*32 - padding`.

### Content Payload (`type:0x0`)
The actual message (e.g. an utf8 text) that to be presented to the user, typically encrypted.
```
<content_type:1byte><content:* bytes>
```
`content_type` is defined in UEP-17.

### Media Offloads (`type:0x1`) 
Multimedia data that is attached to the message, and offloaded to the distributed media store (UEP-16), typically unencrypted.
```
<count:1byte>[<media>:count]
<media> := <hash:32bytes><size:4bytes><timestamp:4bytes><TTL:4bytes><padding:1byte><content_type:1byte><PowNonce:8bytes>
```

### Message Metadata (`type:0x2`)
Message metadata is an encrypted composite payload with multiple attachments as
```
<attachments:2bytes>[<attachment>:popcount(attachments)]
```
`attachments` is bit-wise defined, which indicate the availability of certain attachment. 

#### Tiny Group Information (`bit#0`)
A description of the tiny group including membership (UEP-18).

#### Greeting Profile (`bit#1`)
A basic social profile of the sender `pubkey` as
```
<pubkey:32bytes><size:1byte><datakey:32bytes><social_pref:1byte><gender:1byte><geolocation:2bytes><name:* bytes>
```
`datakey` is the data key for the public profile. `social_pref` is application-specific flags for social preference
of the sender. `size` is the size of the entire data.

#### Secrets for Media Offloads (`bit#5`)
Secret keys for decrypting the media blob in distributed media store (UEP-16), which is ordered and 
corresponded to entries in Media Offloads payload (`type:0x1`) item-by-item.
```
<count:1byte>[<secret:32bytes>:count]
```
`count` here should match with the number of entries in Media Offloads payload.

#### Reserved (`bit#2~#4, bit#6,#7`)
