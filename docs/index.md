# UP4W: United Peers for Web 3.0 

Information spreading on Internet, publicly or privately, has to exclusively depend on social and communication platforms
serving as trusted third parties to relay and delivery user contents, and to discover and maintain social relationships.
Nowadays these systems turn out to be the most fundamental elements of our daily life and even the foundation of our digital civilization,
they suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. 
While all platforms have dictatorial owner controls the entire network over all users, 
such a trust based model can be easily manipulated by targeted advertisements for monetization, exploited 
for massive surveillance, and even abused to deprive anyone of the human right of opinion and expression.

UP4W is devoted to establish a platform without a dictatorial owner that ensures 
**no one in the network has privilege over others** in the protocol level.
It is a family of open and community-driven protocols to enable a homogeneous decentralized network
with only equal peers, and to create a versatile application platform
that is resilient, unstoppable, tamperproof and censorship-resistant.

## UEPs
UP4W Enhancement Proposals (UEPs) describe standards for UP4W protocols,
including core protocol specifications, client APIs, data formats and etc. 

## Contributing
UPW protocol family is open and continuously evolving. It welcomes technical inputs and application ideas from anyone. 
UEPs are the primary approach to collect new features, enhanced designs and protocol research from the community.

## UEP Status
* **Idea:** An idea or an initiative that to be discussed in informal channels. This should not be included in the UEP repository.
* **Draft:** A proposal is working in progress to be formally tracked in the UEP repository.
* **Review:** A proposal is under reviewing by the community peer reviewers and the core development team.
* **Final:** A proposal is finalized, and coordinating community adoption.
* **Revise:** A proposal was approved but will be revised on-demand.
* **Deploy:** A proposal is enabled in the network, or being scheduled to enable in a concrete date.
* **Inactive:** A proposal is inactive for a long time before finalizing.
* **Withdrawn:** A proposal is abandoned by author(s) and will never be active.
