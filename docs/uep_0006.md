# Packet Obfuscation

| UEP-6 |
|:----|

## Motivation
Cases of protocol based packet filtering can be observed on networks of corpnet, public wifi and ICPs in some region. 
In those cases, routers are configured to drop any incoming and outgoing packets with certain patterns in first few bytes.
Packet obfuscation is an optional protocol designed as a simple countermeasure to protocol based filtering. 


## Obfuscate
Given an outgoing packet $P$ with length $s$, the obfuscated data is
```
<cloak_header:1byte><seed:1byte><obfuscated_data:s-bytes>
```
`cloak_header` is a random byte $h < 32$ or $ > 223$, `seed` is another random byte of any value $d$.
`obfuscated_data` is dword-wise xor $P$ with a mask $m= (c\cdot256 + d + 3,133,079,277)^2 \oplus (s + 3,735,928,559)^2$, 
in which $c=h;~(h<32)$ or $c = 287-h;~(h>223)$.
The size of $P$ is aligned to multiplication of DWORD size and truncated to $s$ bytes after dword-wise xor.

## Reconstruct
For an incoming packet with length $r$, the data obfuscation is detected by a initial byte $h < 32$ or $ > 223$.
Note that, this value will not be confused with packet from other protocol as described in UEP-5.
With `cloak_header` and `seed` carried by the packet, the mask $m$ can be computed with $s = r-2$, then 
the originate packet $P$ can be reconstructed by computing the dword-wise xor one more time.
