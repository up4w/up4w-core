# Private Swarms

## Motivation
Private swarms are DHT swarms with permission by requiring a peer-specific token to be sent along with every query and reply message,
so that participants of a swarm can be controlled. 

## Peer-Specific Token
Peer-Specific token is an 8-byte unsigned integer generated using `crc64` based on a swarm-wise pre-negotiated secret and the IP of the peer, which
is constructed as
```C++
extern uint64_t crc64(const void* data, size_t data_size, uint64_t init_val);

uint64_t GetPeerSpecificToken(const NetworkAddress* ip, const uint8_t secret[20])
{
    uint64_t ip_val = crc64(ip, sizeof(IP), *(uint64_t*)secret);
    return crc64(secret, sizeof(secret), ip_val);
}
```
`NetworkAddress` encodes IP address and the port, which is 6-byte for IPv4 and 18-byte for IPv6.

Peer-specific token is added as the `pspn` key with a 8-byte binary in the top-level dictionary of every query and reply message. 
The value of the `pspn` key in all incoming messages will be verified, any unmatched ones will be dropped silently.
