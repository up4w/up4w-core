##### UPW/Core/UEP-5: Protocol Indicator <br> Rev#0: 3/28/2023 by Core Dev Team <br> Status: Revise


# Protocol Indicator

## Motivation
UPW protocols minimize occupation of socket ports by multiplexing packets of different protocols on a single UDP socket.
To distinguish incoming packets of different protocols, the initial byte of every packet is reserved as an indicator.

This proposal records all allocated protocol indicator, and is subject to revise continuously as more protocols deployed
in the future.

## Indicator Allocation
| HEX | Char | Protocol | UEPs |
|:---:|:-----:|----------|------|
|`0x00-0x20`| - | Packet Obfuscation |UEP-6|
|`0x62` | `'b'` | Swarm Broadcast | UEP-10 |
|`0x64` | `'d'` | Mainline DHT with Extensions | UEP-1,2,3,4 |
|`0x66` | `'f'` | Fragmented Packets | UEP-7 |
|`0x67` | `'g'` | Gossip Data | UEP-11 |
|`0x6b` | `'k'` | Distributed Key-Value Store | UEP-20 |
|`0x6c` | `'l'` | Nearby Peers | UEP-8 |
|`0x79` | `'y'` | DAG-linked Application Messages | UEP-12 |
|`0xe0-0xff`| - | Packet Obfuscation |UEP-6|
