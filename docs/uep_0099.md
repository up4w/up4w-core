##### UPW/Protocol/UEP-23: Ciphered Data Value in Distributed Key-Value Store <br> Rev#0: 4/22/2023 by Core Dev Team <br> Status: Deploy


# Ciphered Data Value in Distributed Key-Value Store

## Motivation
Since data in Distributed Key-Value Store (UEP-20) are synchronized across all peers within the swarm, they are visible to any user in the swarm. It is quite common that a user wants to store private data (e.g. contact list) or data that should only be accessible by authorized users (e.g. member list of a chat group). In these cases, the value should be ciphered so that only those with the correct cipher secret can view the original content.

## Value Format
The format of a ciphered data value is as follows:
```
<datavalue_md> := <datakey:32bytes><ciphered_size:4bytes><plain_size:4bytes><plain_crc:8bytes><ciphered:ciphered_size bytes>
```
where:
* `datakey` is the key this value is assigned to;
* `ciphered_size` is the length of the ciphered text;
* `plain_size` is the length of the plain text when deciphered;
* `plain_crc` is the CRC64 of the plain text;
* `ciphered` is the ciphered text.

The `plain_text` could be derived by:
```
plain_text = AES256(ciphered, ciphered_size, cipher_secret)[0..plain_size-1]
```
`cipher_secret` is the secret shared by all participating users.

The deciphered `plain_text` could be verified by:
```
CRC64(plain_text) == plain_crc
```
