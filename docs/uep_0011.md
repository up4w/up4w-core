# Gossip Data

| UEP-6:2B | UEP-11 |
|:----|:-----|

## Motivation
Gossip data protocol (GDP) is designed to replicate large data blobs across all peers in the swarm
and keep available for a period of time, which allows mega-bytes of data to be broadcasted. 
GDP shares similar design philosophy as BitTorrent, a data blob is divided into multiple pages,
which is exchanged page-by-page among peers in the swarm.


## Data Blob
A data blob with `s` bytes is divided into multiple datapages and a datapage is divided
into multiple fragments that each fits a single MTU.
```
<blob> := <datapage#0:g bytes> ... <datapage#n:(s%g) bytes>
<datapage> := <fragment#0:f bytes> ... <fragment_m:(*%f) bytes>
``` 
`g=256*1024` is the maximum GDP datapage size and `f=1408` is the maximum GDP fragment size, 
which is consistent with the fragment size in UEP-7.

A blob is identified by `<hash:32bytes>`, which uniquely determines the content of the data.
A `fragment` is the minimum unit can be retrieved and requested by remote peers,
which is indexed by 
```
<hash:32bytes><page_index:2bytes><fragment_index:1byte>
```
The maximum size of a blob is 17,179,869,184 bytes (16GB), the maximum `page_index` is 65535 and
the maximum `fragment_index` is 186.


## Messages

### Common Header
All request and reply message starts with a common header as
```
<header> := <0x67><opcode:4bits><metadata_use:1bit><end_of_reply:1bit><reserved:2bits><ticket:4bytes>
<push_header> := <0x67><opcode:4bits><metadata_use:1bit><end_of_reply:1bit><reserved:2bits>
```
* `<0x67>` is the protocol indicator as listed in UEP-5, `opcode` indicates the actual operation of the message. 
* `metadata_use` bit indicates the metadata is requested in query messages, and it will be available in reply messages.
* `end_of_reply` bit indicates the current message is the last reply, which is used in reply messages only.
* `ticket` will be echoed as an opaque data in the reply message to make sure it is sent from the peer being requested. 

The data structure of metadata is defined as 
```
<metadata> := <blob_size:27bits><userdata_size:5bits><userdata:userdata_size bytes>
```
`userdata` is an optional application-specific data (`userdata_size` < 32), which is also 
uniquely determined by the `hash`.


### Push New Blob (`opcode:0x0`)
```
"<push_header><hash:32bytes><blob_size:4bytes><meta_size:1byte><meta:meta_size bytes><fragment#0:* bytes>"
```
This message is a broadcast that notifies other peers that a new blob is completely available. No reply is expected, instead, 
any interested peer may send pull message to asking for more data.
`fragment#0` is the data of the first fragment in the first datapage, which is used by upper level application
for pre-verification of the blob and decision making of downloading the entire data.


### Pull Fragments (`opcode:0x1,0x2`)
Pull consecutive fragments (`0x1`) in a specific datapage:
```
"<header><hash:32bytes><page_index:2byte><fragment_index:1byte><fragment_count:1byte>"
```
Pull discrete fragments (`0x2`) in a specific datapage from a starting fragment:
```
"<header><hash:32bytes><page_index:2bytes><fragment_index:1byte><bitmap:* bytes>"
```
`bitmap` is a bit vector indicates discrete index of fragments starting from `fragment_index` of requesting.

Both messages expect multiple reply messages each carries a fragment as requested. 
A peer being queried will response all, or partial, or none of requested fragments, which depends on
the local workload and the data available.


### Reply with a Fragment (`opcode:0x8,0x9`)
As to response to pull messages, multiple reply message (`0x8`) will be sent back as
```
"<header><hash:32bytes><page_index:2bytes><fragment_index:1byte><fragment:* bytes>"
```
If the `metadata_use` bit in the query message header is set, all reply messages will include the metadata (`0x9`) as
```
"<header><hash:32bytes><metadata><page_index:2bytes><blob_size:4bytes><fragment_index:1byte><fragment:* bytes>"
```
A peer will send a series of reply messages back to serve a pull request fully, or partially. 
The last relay will be marked in the `end_of_reply` bit of the header.


## Data Integrity and Availability
Gossip data protocol don't define the data integrity, it relies on upper level to verify the integrity of the data
after a blob is completely received. The `hash` is used to identify a blob, which is unnecessary the result 
of data hashing. The application defines how a `hash` is determined and association with a unique blob, which 
should be some sort of hashing, (Hash256, Merkle Tree Root and etc), that ensures global uniqueness throughout the entire network.

Gossip data protocol assumes data will be available on active peers in the swarm for a certain period of time,
that is determined by upper level application. On serving pull requests, the actual data is retrieved from upper level application. 
Fragments are received, assembled and cached until the blob is completely received, and then pass to applications
for verification and actual store.
