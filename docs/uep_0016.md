# Distributed Media Store

| UEP-6:2B | UEP-16 |
|:----|:-----|

## Motivation
Distributed media store is a complementary to DAG-linked application messages (DAGM) protocol (UEP-12)
to broadcast media blobs of multiple megabytes, and to allow data reusing across 
different DAGM instances and swarms.

## Media Blobs
A media blob is a fixed content encrypted using AES256 with its SHA256 hash value as the secret (`blob_secret`), and is identified by the hash value of its ciphered data. 
The maximum size of a media blob is a configuration of DAGM, which is
up to 16GB while <16MB is recommended though. 

A media blob is always referred as an entry in unencrypted *Media Offloads* payload (UEP-14)
by one or more applications messages may or may not within the same swarm or instance of DAGM.
```
<count:1byte>[<media>:count]
<media> := <hash:32bytes><size:4bytes><ts_min:4bytes><ttl_min:4bytes><padding:1byte><content_type:1byte><pow_nonce:8bytes>
```
`hash` is the identifier of the media also the hash value of the entire encrypted media blob.
`size` is the size of the encrypted data with padding, sized in `padding`.
`ts_min` is the unix timestamp and `ttl_min` is the time-to-live, both in minutes. 
`content_type` is the type of the blob data, defined in UEP-17.
`pow_nonce` is used to construct the proof-of-work will be discussed later.

Referred media blobs in any valid messages will be synchronized among all peers in the swarm
within TTL period, regardless whether the decryption of the message can be done, or not.
Decryption of the media blob data requires the `blob_secret`, which is carried as a part 
of the *Secrets for Media Offloads* `(bit#5)` attachment in the *Message Metadata* payload, 
which is available to the sender and recipients only (UEP-14). 


## Data Transfer and Store
Gossip Data Protocol (UEP-11) is used for transferring media blob data.
All media blob data are stored in a unified storage without distinguishing their originated 
swarms or instances of DAGM. 
After a new message is broadcasted, any media blob referred will be pushed even if the it is already existed.
As for Gossip Data Protocol stack, inbound blob pushing will be accepted and followed with pulling
of the rest of data, only if its `hash` is already discovered from a valid application message
with the corresponding media offload entry.

When a media blob is discovered from a valid inbound message,
the actual data will be pulled, indexed by `hash` and stored in local until expiration.
In addition, the corresponding `media` record will also be stored including `ts_min` and `ttl_min`,
which guides data expiration. 
When a `media` record is received with duplicated `hash`, the existing data will be reused
even if it was downloaded for other swarms or instances of DAGM.
A new `media` record may carry different `ts_min` and `ttl_min`, which will update the existing 
record to maximize the expiration time.


## Anti-Spamming
In consistent with DAGM, anti-spamming is also considered for broadcasting media blobs.
Similar proof-of-work approach is utilized to prevent exhaustive spamming, whose difficulty is proportional
to the size and alive duration. A *work* is computed over the entire `media` record as
```
<Work:32bytes> := SHA256(<hash:32bytes><size:4bytes><ts_min:4bytes><ttl_min:4bytes><padding:1byte><content_type:1byte><pow_nonce:8bytes>)
```
Proof-of-work is solved by finding a `pow_nonce` increasing from a random initialization that
makes `Work` less than a `pow_target` by comparing as 32-bytes big unsigned integers.
```
pow_target = (1<<256)/(100*size + (size*ttl_min))
```
