# Identicon

## Motivation
A default avatar image generated based on user's `pubkey`.


## Graphic Design
![Identicon Cell Layout](./figs/identicon.svg) 
An identicon is a pixelated image with 7x7 tiles. All border tiles are in background color.
Some of internal 5x5 tiles will be in foreground color (set) and the rest are in background color (unset).
Internal tiles are horizontally symmetric and 15 tiles will have independent color choices.

## Encoding
Bits of `CRC32(pubkey)` are encoded in the identicon image as
```
|     Byte#0    |     Byte#1    |     Byte#2    |     Byte#3    |
|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7|
|  Red  |-|  Green  |---| Blue  |      15 color choices       |-|
```
16th~30th bits encode color choices of 15 internal tiles, one bit per-tile.
Color channels of the foreground color are encoded in 0th~3rd bits as `r`, 5th~9th bits as `g` and 12nd~15th bits as `b`.
The foreground color are then derived as `(r*8, g*4, b*8)`.
